Feature: create catalog
        As a master user
        I want to create a catalog
        so I test that works correctly

    Background: login as a master user
        Given I'm in the login page 
        And a username "admin" and a password "admin1234."
        And I press the " Iniciar Sesi√≥n " button
        And I press the "Catalogo" option in the navbar

    Scenario: visit catalog view
